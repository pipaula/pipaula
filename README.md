## ðŸ“ƒ My Passion for Documentation

While many developers shy away from writing documentation, I find it to be an essential part of the development process. To me, a well-documented codebase is just as crucial as the code itself, serving as a narrative that explains what the code does and how it functions. My focus is always on creating documentation that is clear, concise, and practical. For this purpose, I frequently rely on <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a> as my go-to tool.

When crafting documentation, I follow these key principles to ensure itâ€™s as effective as possible:

1. **What** does this documentation cover?
2. **Why** is this information valuable?
3. **How** can the reader implement or use this information?
4. **When** should the reader refer to this documentation?
5. **Who** is the intended audience for this documentation?
